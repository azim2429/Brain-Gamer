Cognitive skills are the core skills your brain uses to think, read, learn, remember, reason, and pay attention. Working together, they take incoming information and move it into the bank of knowledge you use every day at school, at work, and in life. Most of us may not be proficient in every single one of these skills, but they can be mastered with patience and practice.So In order to train the cognitive skills the brain uses to think and learn, in a fun way, our team has developed ‚ÄúBrain Gamer‚Äù.
