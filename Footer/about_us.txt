<ul>	Just as physical exercise helps in improving and strengthening your muscles, cognitive games help to indulge one's brain in constant stimulation, thus improving the brain's performance. The following are some of the cognitive benefits of playing video Games.
</ul><br>
<ul>	Video games involve certain rules. This means that the player has
     to think carefully before making any move to ensure that they stay
     within the required rules of that particular game. The player needs
     to make split- second decisions that will determine whether or not
     he or she will advance to the next level.</ul>

<ul>	Playing your favourite video game may require both visual and Audial memory. The player is required to read or listen to the instructions which might only be provided at the beginning of the 
    game, thus the need to remember them throughout the entire
    game. Mastery of the keys on your keyboard helps you easily move your characters in the game. This helps improve your memory, whether short- term or long-term.
</ul><br>
<ul>	Video games especially action games, have proven to be able to
    capture the player's attention for the entire period of the game. This is brought about by the player's need to achieve certain objectives within the game, and be able to progress to the next level.
</ul><br>
<ul>	Gaming is not only beneficial to adults and teenagers, but to children as well. Many modern education institutions incorporate video games as a teaching methodology. This helps these children improve their academic skills by providing video games that are specifically aimed at enhancing their cognitive and creative skills.
</ul><br>
<ul>	While gaming, the brain receives multiple stimulations, both Visual and audial. According to research, individuals who play video games frequently can process these stimulators faster than others. These stimulators ensure that the brain is continuously working to interpret them.
